## 🎉 Motivation
Last year, I started reading Metal by Tutorials from Kodeco and was fascinated by GPU programming, particularly the process of building a graphic rendering engine. This led me to develop a note-taking app with a 2D render engine using Metal. There were a lot of challenges throughout, and I initially thought it would be a flop. However, I managed to figure out workarounds to get a functional render engine. I know it is not perfect yet and there are a lot of battles to be won in optimizing render efficiency and adding more writing tools. Regardless, I feel like it is ready to lauch the app and make the code open-source.
