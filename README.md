## Motivation
Metal is a fascinating framework where we can leverage the optimal power of GPUs through compute shaders and rendering shaders to build advanced applications powered by GPUs. This raised multiple questions like "How is the render pipeline constructed?" and "How are renders generated?" which led to an adventurous journey of crafting a 2D render engine. That's how Memola, started to dive into the world of GPU programming.
